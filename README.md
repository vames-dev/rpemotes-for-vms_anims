# RPEmotes for vms_anims
Prepared list of animations from [TayMcKenzieNZ](https://forum.cfx.re/u/taymckenzienz/summary) RPEmotes resource for vms_anims.

The above animations are not configured by me, only converted animation loading table.

## **How can you use it?**
1. Go to ***`vms_anims/config/animations.lua`***.
2. Copy the animations from the ***`animations.lua`*** file from this github.
3. Paste the new animations into ***`vms_anims/config/animations.lua`*** in the appropriate place.
4. Keep in mind that a large part of the animations from RPEmotes have custom props created by creators, in order for them all to work properly, you need to stream the files, for that go to [**archive RPEmotes github**](https://github.com/MLGCrisis/rpemotes/tree/master).
5. Download the entire stream folder from the above given github.
6. Upload the entire stream folder to your vms_anims.
7. Start the server and enjoy the new animations.


* We do not support the installation of animation to vms_anims, in case of problems check our documentation to verify the correct animation tables.
